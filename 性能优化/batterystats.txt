Battery History: 耗电统计的历史记录，每一条记录以HistoryItem的形式存在
Battery History (98% used, 504 used of 512KB, 31 strings using 1780):
用于存储HistoryItem的缓存并非无限大，Android默认为512KB，此处使用了504KB，所以使用率为98%
                    0 (10) RESET:TIME: 2019-08-28-15-45-14
					0: 表示当前开始统计的起点时间
					(10): 从缓存中读取的子节数
					RESET命令，该处可能出现的另外命令还有START(开机时的统计记录)，SHUTDOWN(关机时的统计记录)，OVERFLOW(缓冲区溢出的记录)。 RESET和START命令会打印出当前的时间，即TIME: 2018-08-23-10-49-00
                    0 (2) 100 status=discharging health=good plug=none temp=300 volt=4351 charge=1 +running +wake_lock +wifi_radio phone_signal_strength=great +wifi_running +wifi +usb_data wifi_signal_strength=3 wifi_suppl=completed gps_signal_quality=good top=1000:"com.android.settings"
					100 当前电量百分值，随着时间的推移，这个值会逐渐减少
					status: 充电状态(unknown未知状态，charging充电状态，discharging放电状态，not-charging没有充电，full已充满)
					health: 电池状态(unknown未知状态，good正常，overheat过热，dead已坏，over-voltage电压过高，cold过冷)
					plug: 插拔连接状态(none未插拔，ac交流电，usb数据线，wireless无线连接)
					temp: 电池温度
					volt: 电池电压
					state: 主动记录的影响耗电的硬件工作状态，这些状态从字面意思就能理解
					部分状态前面会带上+或者-，+表示进入状态，-表示离开状态，譬如: +running表示CPU进入运行状态，-wakelock表示释放锁
					部分状态设置了状态值。譬如: phone_signal_strength=great表示当前手机信号很强
					wakeup_reason: 如果存在，则会打印唤醒的理由
					event: 被动通知的影响耗电的事件，event会带上事件源的uid
					部分事件前面会带上+或者-，+表示进入事件，-表示离开事件，譬如: +top=u0a70:”com.test.mygame”表示当前进入显示的界面为com.test.mygame，事件源的uid为u0a70
					所有事件都有一个描述值，即=右边的内容
                    0 (2) 100 user=0:"0"
                    0 (2) 100 userfg=0:"0"
					这是第三条和第四条HistoryItem记录，分别记录了两个事件(event)，Android系统进程启动完成时会通知batterystats: 记录当前的系统用户(USER_SYSTEM，默认编号是0)
					
					剩下的HistoryItem记录，用时间序记录了耗电过程，整个过程其实就是硬件状态和耗电事件交替发生变化。随着时间的推移，系统在睡眠中会被唤醒，CPU开始运转，蓝牙可能开始工作，不良应用可能持锁不放导致系统无法休眠，这些都直接反映到了上述日志中。

  Discharge step durations: 每掉一隔电的时间点和设备的状态、
  第#0条记录，表示用了33分25秒的时间，电量从63%已经掉到62%，手机此时的状态是：不在省电状态(power-save-off)，也不在空闲状态(device-idle-off)。 当然，在掉电的过程中，手机还可能处于其他状态：

	screen-on/scree-off：屏幕是否点亮。如果我们发现日志中，screen-on这个状态高频出现，那说明手机处于比较耗电的状态中。
	power-save-on/power-save-off：是否开启省电模式。在设置中，可以打开手机进入省电模式的开关，在省电状态下，手机会降低运行性能、禁止一些后台服务(譬如收邮件、定位等)。默认情况下，该开关是关闭的，既手机处于power-save-off的状态。
	device-idle-on/device-idle-off：是否处于空闲状态。从Android M(6.0)开始，就引入了Doze模式，简单来说，就是手机满足一定的条件(灭屏、静止、没有充电)时，就会进入到一种休眠状态(IDLE)，在这种状态下，所有CPU、网络、外设的使用请求都会被搁置。在深度休眠一段时间后，手机又会被唤醒，留出一小段窗口期(IDLE_MAINTAINESS)，执行之前搁置的请求。

Statistics since last charge: 从上次充电以来的统计详情，包含很多子板块
Statistics since last charge:
自从上次充电以来的电量统计，既最近一次拔下充电线，仅仅使用手机电池的统计。这一部分日志是重点，包含很多方面的信息。

我们先来看整个耗电的统计概览
  System starts: 0, currently on battery: false

  Connectivity changes: 4
  Total partial wakelock time: 9s 23ms
  System starts：手机重启次数，currently on battery：当前是否正在使用电池
Estimated battery capacity：电池总容量
Time on battery：电池使用时间。这个有两个时间：
realtime：正常流逝的时间，通常把这个时间叫做“墙上时间(walltime)”，就像挂在墙上的时钟一样，走过了一小时就是小时
uptime：CPU工作的时间。“墙上时间”经过一小时，但CPU可能就工作了一分钟，其他时间CPU都在休眠
这两个时间结合在一起，就能够知道休眠率： (realtime-uptime)/realtime，既手机休眠的时间占整个待机时间的比率。休眠率越高，就表明越省电。

Time on battery screen off：在灭屏状态下，电池的使用时间。通常，在灭屏时，我们希望手机可以快速进入休眠状态，所以，这里计算出的休眠率使我们考察耗电问题的重要指标
Time on battery screen doze：在Doze状态下，电池的使用时间
Total run time：总共的电池使用时间
Discharge：放电量，既总共使用的电量
Screen off discharge：灭屏状态下的放电量
Screen doze discharge：Doze状态下的放电量
Screen on discharge：亮屏状态下的放电量
Start clock time：开始电量统计的时刻
Screen brightnesses：屏幕在不同亮度下的时间
Total partial wakelock time：应用层持有wakelock的总时间
在分析耗电问题时，需要综合考量这些指标。有几个重要的指标都已经高亮突出了，本例中的日志，休眠率高达99.7%，说明手机基本都在休眠，这也是可以待机12天的原因

	Capacity: 电池容量, Computed drain: 计算得到的耗电量, actual drain: 实际耗电量。本例中，计算得到的耗电量(28440mAh)竟然是实际耗电量(2410~2465mAh)的10几倍，进一步说明耗电统计只是一个近似计算
Cell standby：射频待机的耗电量。正是由于这里计算出了26122mAh的耗电量，导致总体计算值出现了很大的偏差。为什么会计算出这么大的值呢？要么是单位电流值配置出错了，要么是使用时间计算出错了
Bluetooth：蓝牙使用的耗电量。
Uid XXX：一个Uid的耗电量，可以近似理解为一个应用的耗电量。在高版本的日志中，会再进行细分，括号中cpu=26.3 wake=0.00869 sensor=0.00279，就表明一个应用使用cpu的电量是26.3mAh，持有wake lock的耗电量是0.00869mAh，使用传感器的耗电量是0.00279mAh
这一部分日志是按照耗电量的从大到小排序的，通常我们只需关注头部耗电占比严重的模块

  一旦有内核持锁，那CPU是无法休眠的，一直以较高的频率运行导致的结果就是耗电。 上面日志中，累计持锁时间最长的是[timerfd]，累计持锁13238次，累计时长11分57秒。这是一份待机12天的日志，累计最长时间的内核锁仅仅持锁了不到12分钟，说明只是一些正常的唤醒。

对于应用而言，是不能直接使用内核锁的，需要通过Android提供的Wake Lock机制，使用PowerManager接口来申请和释放锁。应用可以持有多个不同的锁，但反应到内核的锁也就三种：

PowerManagerService.WakeLocks：控制CPU状态的锁
PowerManagerService.Display： 控制屏幕状态的锁
PowerManagerService.Broadcasts：控制电源状态改变的通知锁
如果在这部分日志中，发现以上三种锁持有时间很长，那说明很可能是应用使用Wake Lock不当导致的

  在一些应用场景下，需要保持CPU处于工作状态，譬如：打游戏、看视频、灭屏听音乐、后台下载等，这时候，就要向框架层的电源管理服务申请Wake Lock，再由框架层决策是否向内核申请锁。
  上面的日志中，RILJ_ACK_WL这个来自uid 1001的锁累计持锁时间最长，为24分4秒，累计被唤醒了6700次。

这里介绍几个比较常见：

RIJ：通信上层需要向Modem发送数据时，会获取名为RIJ的锁
RILJ_ACK_WL：通信上层收到Modem上报的数据后，需要向Modem回复一个ACK，此时会获取名为RILJ_ACK_WL的锁
NetworkStats：进行流量统计时所持有的锁
*walarm*或者*alarm*： 通过AlarmManager唤醒所持有的锁
*job*/xxx：通过JobScheduler调度的任务所持有的锁
*vibrator*：在震动状态下所持有的锁
deviceidle_maint：进入Doze Maintainace状态所持有的锁，此时，手机从深度睡眠中唤醒，用很短的时间执行之前被搁置的CPU任务
如果我们对常见的锁比较了解，就能够评估出CPU时间究竟被什么任务占用了。正常情况下，任何一个锁都不应该长时间不释放，导致严重耗电的往往是那些持锁时间较长的进程。

  Resource Power Manager Stats
  Android中预设的uid都是小于10000的，应用进程的uid是在[10000,19999]这个区间分配的，为了描述方便，10000就用字符a代替了，例如：u0a21就表示uid为10021，前面的u0表示这是user 0(默认的Android用户编号就是0)。

注意：Android用户的编号不同于uid，Android是一个多用户系统，会为每一个用户分配一个用户编号，通常我们的手机就我们自己用，对多用户的感受不明显，但如果映射到Window上的用户，就好理解了，管理员和普通用户就是两个不同的用户，不同的用户可以独立管理自己的桌面和文件，互不影响。

uid是linux用户的概念，Android为了做进程隔离，借用linux的uid来隔离不同进程的数据，这就是所谓的“沙箱机制”。Android为每一个包都分配了一个uid，简单理解，我们安装一个APK时，就会为这个APK分配一个uid，一旦分配完成，这个uid就不会改变了。运行这个APK时，这个uid就会映射到一个或多个进程。当然，Android还提供另外一种机制，通过sharedUserId和签名可以将不同APK运行在同一个进程中，但此时，不同APK的uid是一样的，都是sharedUserId配置的值。

理解了uid的概念后，先来看uid为0的耗电详情：
